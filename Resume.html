	<h1> Resume </h1>

<div id="BetterMargins">



	<h4> Summary </h4>
		<p>
			If you were to know only one thing about me, it is that I am passionate. I believe that every job, no matter how small, is important to someone and should be executed to the best of my ability. Competing with myself to do better every day helps me stay positive and motivated, and gives me the energy to inspire those around me to be better themselves. I am also passionate about productivity. If there is a way to do something more efficiently, I believe it is my job to find it. Efficiency, in my opinion, means finding the best way to complete a task so one has more time to complete other tasks. 
			If you are looking for someone with people and management skills, the ability to excel, and the tenacity to succeed, then I hope we get the chance to meet.
