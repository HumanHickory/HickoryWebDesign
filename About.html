		<h2> Hickory Web Designs </h2>

		<p>
		Hickory Web Desigsn is a company founded on the idea that local businesses should not have to spend countless hours
		learning how to build websites, nor should they have to spend $3000 on a basic, functional website to help improve
		business. 
		
		<br/> <br/>

		Many web designers charge thousands of dollars to create beautiful websites that take months to make. These websites
		tend to be overly-<q>flashy</q>, which is great for large organizations, but can take away from the simplicity and warmth
		of a small, local business.  Hickory Web Designs focuses on the heart of the business and can bring a functional website to 
		life in days. So, if you are looking for an affordable website that makes your customers feel at home, you have come to the
		right place!

		Jordon Meredith is a Computer Science student at American Public University interested
		in web development, web analytics, mobile application development, and database managment. 
		In early 2016, Jordon found herself spending unnecessary hours pulling reports, compiling information, 
		and creating easy-to-read print outs for her team. In order to increase productivity, she decided to learn
		<a href="http://www.excel-easy.com/vba.html" target="_blank"> Excel Visual Basics for Application</a>, a programming language
		that allows for easy formatting within the Microsoft Office Suite. Tasks that had previously taken up to one
		hour now only took three or four minutes. This achievement launched Jordon into the world of programming.
	
	<br/> <br/>

		Currently, Jordon has completed foundational certificates through <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/" target="_blank">
		SoloLearn</a> for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java, and has taken countless classes on the subject. Using 
		knowledge gained through these various classes and, especially, long hours
		of practice, Jordon hopes to bring affordable web sites to local businesses. 



	<br/> <br/> 
		It is estimated that Jordon will finish her degree in July, 2018.</p>
