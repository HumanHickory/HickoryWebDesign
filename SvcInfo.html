	<h2> Q&A </h2>

	<div class='section content'>

	<p class="important"> What is web design? </p>

		<p> Web design is the creation of web pages using standardized 'languages'. </p> <br/>

	</div>

	<div class='section content'>

	<p class="important"> What are languages? </p>

		<p> Languages, when it comes to web design are programming languages. Basically, they're languages that have been
		created to communicate with the computer. There are many languages out there that all have different purposes. </p> <br/>
	
	</div>

	<div class='section content'>


	<p class="important"> What languages do websites use? </p>

		<p> Websites use all sorts of languages. The most well-known is HTML5. That's what web pages are actually written in.
		However, we also use CSS to style the website. Notice that the navigation bar, headers, text fonts and colors are the 
		same on all of my web pages (and almost every website out there)? We use CSS to create conformity.
		<br/> <br/>
		JavaScript is another popular language for web design and can be written with HTML or using a seperate sheet. 
		JavaScript let's you 'do' certain things, like change margins or create pop-ups while someone is on the page. 
		<br/><br/>
		These three are the most fundamental languages of web design. Other languages, such as SQL and PHP require servers and
		databases to work with information. Adding SQL and PHP to websheets not only requires the addition of two more languages,
		but also requires setting up a seperate server. With that said, SQL and PHP allow for some really cool stuff to be done
		with a website. </p> <br/>

	</div>

	<div class='section content'>

	<p class="important"> Is it easy to do? </p>
		
		<p> Yes and no. If you are very passionate about it then, with time and practice, it becomes very easy. However, 
		be prepared to spend hours upon hours figuring out how to do one small thing in the beginning. </p> <br/>

	</div>

	<div class='section content'>

	<p class="important"> Where do you build the website? </p>
		
		<p> The website will be built offline in a text editor. Together, we will be able to choose colors, fonts, images
		then make adjustments until it is perfect. All of this is done, again, offline, so clients will not have access 
		to a half-created website. </p> <br/>

	</div>

	<div class='section content'>
	
	<p class="important"> What happens after it is ready? </p>
		
		<p> Once the site is ready we will have to choose a host. A host is a site that stores your files and puts them 
		online for you. If your website is just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, there are free options for you. However, if you
		need a website that stores customer information and/or makes sales, there will be other fees included. 
		<br/> <br/>
		Next, you will need to purchase a domain name if you want something that is not generic. A domain name is the thing
		you see in the URL. For example, "HickoryWebDesigns.com". "HickoryWebDesigns" is my domain name, that has been purchased.
		Since I own it, no one else can use it. This prevents traffic confusion; can you imagine going to a URL and getting
		a different website each time! A generic name is usually created for you for free with a hosting service, but most 
		companies prefer to have their own. Domain names, for the most part, are pretty inexpensive. </p> <br/>

	</div>

	<div class='section content'>

	<p class="important"> What if I don't understand any of this? </p>

		<p> That's what we're here for! All of our web design packages include the creation of the website,
		uploading it to a host and adding a domain name. However, some packages do not include the hosting
		or domain name prices. </p> <br/> 

	</div>

	<div class='section content'>

	<p class="important"> How do I get a logo? </p>
		
		<p> The best way to get a logo is to make one yourself. There are a few programs out there that will allow you to do 
		this. If you are not confident creating one yourself, then finding a graphic artist or using a logo design website
		is your best bet. Make sure your logo is trademarked! </p> <br/>

	</div>

	<div class='section content'>

	<p class="important"> What about custom packages? </p>
		
		<p> Hickory Web Designs is incredibly flexible. We understand that every buisness is different and has different needs.
		We are more than happy to create custom packages with flexible pricing! Let us know what we can do to help! 
		<br/> <br/>
		Finally, we may offer services that are not listed on the site. Please feel free to ask about services not listed
		if you need them. We will do everything we can to provide you with a full solution!
